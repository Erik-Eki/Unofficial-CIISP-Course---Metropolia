# Audits
* Auditing is part of a quality control and risk management process
* Security audits are performed to ascertain the validity and reliability of existing controls and countermeasures
* Audit is a useful tool in SDLC
### Auditors must be independent
* External auditors hired to present an independent vision and evaluation
* Internal Auditors integrating a separate line of reporting in order to preserve independence
### Common audits
* Risk Assesment
* Compliance Assesment
* Technical Assessment
* External Assessment (penetration testing)
* Performance audit

### Phase 1: Pre-Engagement Work
* Obtain an understanding of the organization and its processes
* Define Audit Scope for assessment
* Define an Audit Plan that includes the auditee and business objectives
* Create a "Term of reference", a document that confirms the client's and the IS auditor's acceptance of a review assignment
* Plan should be endorsed by the audit management
* Define an Audit Program
* Describe the audit steps planned
* Identify management and personnel resources
* Identity any limitations in the audit and the program
* Establish Contigency Actions for sensible tests


### Phase 2: Data collection
* Interviews
* Testing
* Direct Observation
* Evidence collection


### Phase 3: Data analysis
* Techincal reports
* Check for false positives
* Establish a "Proof Of Concept"
* Seek for compensatory controls
* Mark verified problems as "findings"
* Data flows
* Check unnecessary data flows
* Check inbound-outbound data flows
* Identify data flows between distinct security levels
* Mark all above as "findings"
* Depedencies
* Check operative depedencies
* Identify permission dependecies
* Mark abnormal issues as "findings"
* Workflow
* Terminate all processes
* Search for unfinished enpoints
* Search for missing links
* Identify non existing connections
* Mark above items as "Findings"


### Phase 4: Recommendations
* Recommendations should directly derivate from findings
* One finding should link to a recommendation
* Recommendations should be considered for immediate mitigation or strategic
* Best practices are "nice to have's" that dont't present current risk
* Observation is accepted and documented risk
* Recommendations should be categorized and priority assigned
* Recommendations may be subject to risk management
* Compensatory controls should be used
* Risk acceptance is a viable outcome
* Auditor's task is to document and suppor decisions, not to take decisions


### Phase 5: Reporting & Results Presentation
* "Do's"
    * Present a non-technical executive summary
    * Identify top 5 problems
    * Be factual
    * Be flexible
    * Be descriptive
    * Be open minded
    * Collect all evidence
    * Document all actions
    * Be practical and result oriented
    * Use graphics, workflows and radars
* "DontÂ´s"
    * Be biased towards a specific person, technology or solution
    * Be influenced
    * State something you can't sustain
    * Exclude specific contstraints
    * Push decisions regarding risk management
    * Focus on a particular problem
